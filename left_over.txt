In crud.html I describe the CRUD acronym to say that I can use D3.js to operate on HTML which resides in your browser.

The U in CRUD stands for Update.

A useful D3.js method which can Update HTML is the data() method.

The scenario below helps me understand the data() method.

I use emacs to create 4 li-elements.

Next, I create a JS array called myarray which has 4 values.

Then, I create a D3 object named li_sel from the 4 li-elements.

Next, I 'join' myarray with li_sel using the data() method like this:

joined_sel = li_sel.data(myarray);
