Which JS files does crossfilter-app serve to the browser?
a:
-rw-rw-r-- 1 dan dan    9561 Oct 18 19:50 crossfilter.v1.min.js
-rw-rw-r-- 1 dan dan  144801 Oct 18 19:50 d3.v3.min.js

Where does cf-app get data from?
a:
The data comes from a local file served to the browser:
flights-3m.json

Is the data in JSON format?
a:
No, actually it is CSV.
Perhaps the intent behind the json-suffix is to ask github.com to compress flights-3m.json

In crossfilter.html, what does this syntax do:
@import url(http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Yanone+Kaffeesatz:400,700);
??
a: Perhaps CSS has an remote-import mechanism?
